## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(treemap)
library(ggthemes)
library(ggforce)
library(treemapify)
```

## DATA LOADING
```{r}
data <-read.csv("world-data.csv")
# Convert Year to numeric if needed
data$Year <- as.numeric(data$Year)
# Check dataset structure
str(data)
```


## Q-1 Download world bank data explorer dataset and implement visualizations possible on educational indicators for the following, using dplyr.

## a. Present the wider and longer format of data for expenditure of any specific year.
```{r}
df_2010 <- data %>% filter(Year == 2010)
# Convert to Longer Format
df_long <- df_2010 %>% pivot_longer(cols = c(Expenditure), names_to = "Indicator", values_to
= "Value")
# Convert to Wider Format
df_wide <- df_long %>% pivot_wider(names_from = Indicator, values_from = Value)
# Print outputs
print(df_long)

```

```{r}
print(df_wide)
```

 ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Expenditure, fill = factor(Year))) +
 geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Education Expenditure (2001 vs 2010)", x = "Country", y =
"Expenditure (%)")

```

## Stacked Bar chart

```{r}
data %>% filter(Year %in% c(2001, 2010)) %>%
 ggplot(aes(x = Country, y = Expenditure, fill = factor(Year))) +
 geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Stacked Bar Chart of Education Expenditure", x = "Country",
y = "Expenditure (%)")

## Scatterplot matrix

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Expenditure, color = Country)) +
 geom_point() + facet_wrap(~ Country) +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Scatterplot Matrix of Education Expenditure")
```

## Facet grid and wrap

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

ggplot(data %>% filter(Year %in% c(2001, 2010)), 
       aes(x = Expenditure, y = Literacy_Adult, color = factor(Year))) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(~ Country) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Facet Wrap: Literacy vs Expenditure",
       color = "Year")

```


## c. Plot the expenditure in 1990 against 2014 using the `ggplot2` package.

```{r}
df_1990_2014 <- data %>% filter(Year %in% c(1990, 2014))
ggplot(df_1990_2014, aes(x = Year, y = Expenditure, color = Country)) +
 geom_line(aes(group = Country)) + geom_point() +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Education Expenditure Trend (1990 vs 2014)")
```

## d. Print the country spent more in 1990 and country spent more in 2014.

```{r}
top_1990 <- data %>% filter(Year == 1990) %>% arrange(desc(Expenditure)) %>% head(1)
top_2014 <- data %>% filter(Year == 2014) %>% arrange(desc(Expenditure)) %>% head(1)
print(top_1990)
```

```{r}
print(top_2014)
```

## e. Compare fluctuations on expenditure in an indicator’s value across all the years.

```{r}
ggplot(data, aes(x = Year, y = Expenditure, color = Country)) +
 geom_line() + geom_point() +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Fluctuations in Education Expenditure Across Years")
```

## f. Display the literacy rate versus unemployment rate in 2012 for adults.

```{r}
df_2012 <- data %>% filter(Year == 2012)
ggplot(df_2012, aes(x = Literacy_Adult, y = Unemployment_Adult, color = Country)) +
 geom_point(size = 3) +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Literacy Rate vs Unemployment Rate (Adults, 2012)")
```

## g. Display the literacy rate versus unemployment rate in 2012 for female.

```{r}
ggplot(df_2012, aes(x = Literacy_Female, y = Unemployment_Female, color = Country)) +
 geom_point(size = 3) +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Literacy Rate vs Unemployment Rate (Females, 2012)")

```

## h.  Print the hierarchical plot applicable such as heatmap, tree map, circle packing and sunburst diagrams.

## heatmap
```{r}
df_heatmap <- df_2012 %>% 
  select(Literacy_Adult, Literacy_Female, Unemployment_Adult, Unemployment_Female)

corr_matrix <- cor(df_heatmap, use = "complete.obs")

ggcorrplot(corr_matrix, 
           hc.order = TRUE, 
           lab = TRUE,
           title = "Correlation Heatmap (2012 Data)")
```
## treemap

```{r}
df_tree <- df_2012 %>% select(Country, Expenditure)
treemap(df_tree,
 index = "Country",
 vSize = "Expenditure",
 title = "Education Expenditure by Country (2012)")
```

## circle packing

```{r}
ggplot(df_2012, aes(area = Expenditure, fill = Country, label = Country)) +

 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Circle Packing: Education Expenditure")

```

## sunburst diagram
```{r}
ggplot(df_2012, aes(area = Expenditure, fill = Country, label = Country)) +
 geom_treemap() +
 geom_treemap_text(grow = TRUE, reflow = TRUE) +
 theme_minimal() + labs(title = "Sunburst-like Treemap: Education Expenditure")

```

## 2. Visualize the relationship between petal length and petal width across different species of flowers in the Iris dataset. Create a scatter plot with different colors representing species.

```{r}
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Petal.Length, y = Petal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Petal Length vs Petal Width in Different Species", x = "Petal Length", y = "Petal Width")

```

## 3. Study the effect of supplement type and dosage on tooth growth. Create a grouped bar chart to compare the average tooth length across supplement types and dosages.

```{r}
ggplot(ToothGrowth, aes(x = factor(dose), y = len, fill = supp)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Effect of Supplement Type and Dosage on Tooth Growth", x = "Dosage", y = "Tooth Length")

```

## 4.  Visualize the uptake of CO2 for plants grown under different conditions. Create a faceted line chart for CO2 uptake over time, with facets for different treatment conditions.

```{r}
ggplot(CO2, aes(x = conc, y = uptake, color = Treatment)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_wrap(~Type) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "CO2 Uptake over Time", x = "Concentration", y = "Uptake")
```

## 5. Compare the number of breaks across different tension levels and wool types in weaving. Create a stacked bar chart for the number of breaks grouped by wool type and tension level.

```{r}
ggplot(warpbreaks, aes(x = tension, y = breaks, fill = wool)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "stack") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Breaks across Tension and Wool Type", x = "Tension Level", y = "Number of Breaks")

```

## 6. Analyze the waiting time between eruptions of the Old Faithful geyser. Create a histogram to show the distribution of waiting times.

```{r}
ggplot(faithful, aes(x = waiting)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5, fill = "blue", color = "black", alpha = 0.7) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Waiting Time Distribution of Old Faithful Geyser", 
       x = "Waiting Time", 
       y = "Count")
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
